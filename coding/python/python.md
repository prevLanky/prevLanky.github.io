## Python Hello World

```python
print("Hello from Python!")


---

## Step 5: Upload images (optional)

- Use **Add file > Upload files** inside your folders like `snippets/images/`
- Link to images with relative paths as shown above

---

## Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo **Settings > Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select:
    - Branch: `main`
    - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Save

---

## Step 7: Visit your live website!

- Go to `https://yourusername.github.io`
- Your site is live, rendered by GitHub’s Jekyll with your Markdown content and theme

---

## Bonus tips

- Edit and add new pages **directly on GitHub** or clone locally if you want
- Customize `_config.yml` to tweak your site’s title, description, and theme
- Use Markdown code blocks with triple backticks (```) for syntax highlighting

If you want, I can create a **starter GitHub repo** with this exact structure and example pages so you can fork and customize it immediately. Would you like that?
