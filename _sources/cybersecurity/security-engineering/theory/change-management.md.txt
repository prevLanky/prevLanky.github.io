# Change Management
Change management ensures security is maintained as systems evolve. Any change should be assessed for security impact.

For example, upgrading an e-commerce system requires risk assessment, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing before deployment. The goal is to ensure the change does not introduce new vulnerabilities and remains compliant with security policies.
