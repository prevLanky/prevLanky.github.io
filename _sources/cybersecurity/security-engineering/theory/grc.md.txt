# GRC

GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) provides a structured way to manage security and risk across an organization. The three areas are closely connected and supported by assurance activities that confirm controls are working as intended.

## Governance
Governance defines how security is directed, managed, and enforced within an organization. It sets the strategy, policies, roles, and responsibilities for security and risk management. Governance ensures that security aligns with business objectives and risk appetite.

In practice, governance includes:
- Security policies and standards
- Decision-making structures and accountability
- Defined roles such as system owners and risk owners

Sometimes business requirements make it impractical to fully follow a policy. In these cases, a formal exception process is used. Exceptions must be approved by the appropriate authority, documented, time-limited, and supported by compensating controls to reduce risk.

### COBIT
COBIT is a governance framework that focuses on aligning IT and security with business goals. It defines processes, control objectives, and performance metrics to ensure effective governance.

Other commonly used governance frameworks include ITIL, ISO 27001, and internal governance models tailored to the organization.


## Risk
Risk management identifies what can go wrong, how likely it is, and what the impact would be. Risks are then treated by avoiding, mitigating, transferring, or accepting them.

Typical risk management activities include:
- Identifying assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Performing risk analysis and prioritization
- Selecting and implementing risk treatments
- Ongoing risk monitoring

### NIST SP 800 – Risk analysis and patch management
The NIST SP 800 series provides structured guidance for risk management. It supports identifying risks, assessing their impact, and reducing them through controls such as patch management.

Patch management reduces risk by fixing known vulnerabilities. However, patches themselves introduce change and must be assessed and tested to avoid introducing new risks.


## Compliance
Compliance ensures that the organization meets external and internal requirements, such as laws, regulations, standards, and contractual obligations.

Examples include GDPR for personal data protection, PCI DSS for payment systems, and ISO 27001 for information security management.

Compliance activities typically include:
- Mapping requirements to controls
- Collecting evidence
- Performing internal and external audits

Compliance does not guarantee security, but it provides a baseline level of control and accountability.


## Assurance
Assurance provides confidence that governance, risk, and compliance activities are effective and working as intended. It answers the question: “Are the controls actually doing what we expect them to do?”

Assurance is achieved through:
- Audits (internal and external)
- Security testing (e.g. penetration tests, vulnerability scans)
- Continuous monitoring and logging
- Metrics, reporting, and management reviews

The required level of assurance depends on exposure and potential impact. Critical systems and high-risk assets require stronger and more frequent assurance activities.


## Assurance across the GRC framework

### Assurance in Governance
Assurance confirms that governance structures and policies are properly defined and followed.  
Examples include policy reviews, management reporting, and audits of decision-making processes. This ensures accountability and consistent enforcement.

### Assurance in Risk
Assurance validates that risks are correctly identified, assessed, and treated.  
Examples include verifying risk assessments, testing controls linked to high-risk scenarios, and reviewing whether accepted risks remain within tolerance.

### Assurance in Compliance
Assurance demonstrates that regulatory and contractual requirements are met.  
This is typically done through compliance audits, evidence collection, and independent reviews.

Overall, assurance acts as the feedback loop of GRC. It provides visibility, supports informed decision-making, and enables continuous improvement by identifying gaps between expected and actual security posture.
