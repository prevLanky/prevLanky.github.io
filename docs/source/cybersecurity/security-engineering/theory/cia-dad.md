## Confidentiality
Confidentiality is about making sure information is only accessible to people or systems that are authorized to see it.  
This is usually achieved through access controls, encryption, and proper authentication.  


## Integrity
Integrity ensures that data is accurate, complete, and has not been modified without authorization.  
Mechanisms like hashing, checksums, and digital signatures are commonly used.  


## Availability
Availability means that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.  
This often involves redundancy, backups, and protection against denial-of-service attacks.  


## Authenticity
Authenticity is about confirming that users, devices, or systems are who they claim to be.  
This is typically enforced through authentication mechanisms.  

## Nonrepudiation
Nonrepudiation ensures that a user cannot deny having performed an action.  
This is commonly achieved through logging and digital signatures.  


## Disclosure
Disclosure refers to the unauthorized exposure of information.  
This is a violation of confidentiality.  


## Alteration
Alteration occurs when data is changed without authorization.  
This is a violation of integrity.  


## Destruction / Denial
Destruction or denial refers to data or services being made unavailable.  
This is a violation of availability.
